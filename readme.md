# Eye Movement Tracker

![eyes that follow your cursor around the screen](./eyes.png)
These eyes follow your mouse cursor around the screen. I made them while learning about how to manipulate the DOM and use getElementByClassName. From the MITx Fullstack Certificate Course.

## How to run:

1) Download this repository.
2) Open index.html in your browser. 
3) Voila!

## Upcoming Features:

- Eyes designed to fit in any container element
- Eyes that sparkle as your cursor approaches
- Eyes that turn red when you poke them with your mouse
